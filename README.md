Knowledge Translation AssignmentFor   this   Assignment,   you   are   going   to   prepare   a 4 min video presentation or an Infographic poster for   a   hypothetical   ‘Partner   organization’   .   The   video   or   infographic   could   be   used   as   an Educational Tool related to the health effects of cannabis. The   partner   may want to   upload   the   video    onto   their    web    site    or    use    it    as    part    of    a      bigger    presentation   or   send      a      link    to    their   community. They may use the Infographic as a Poster or a handout. The material should be aimed   at   non-scientists and   be easily   understood   by someone with a   High   School   level   education.
The   hypothetical   Partner Organizations   are   (choose   1   partner):
1.       Toronto District School Board. 
2.       Campus Health  Wellness. 
3.       Arthritis Society of Canada. 
4.       Children’s Mental Health Ontario (CMHO). 
5.       Cannabis Company specializing in medical cannabis. 
6.       Cannabis Company specializing in edibles for non-medical market. Note that your video or   infographic could   be directed towards   teachers or students   (TDSB)   or   for   doctors or patients   (Arthritis   Society)   or   Parent or Children   (CMHO)   or   Staff or Customers   (Cannabis   Company).   You need to identify your chosen audience before starting your assignment. It’s important that you decide who the audience   will   be.
***VERY IMPORTANT Note***: 
Your hypothetical partner may already have resources on their webpages 
- Don’t use these for your assignment 
- They maybe inaccurate 
Some reasons why resources online maybe inaccurate: 
- The research is changing fast – new data, new publications – it might be out of date. 
- The info on websites might not be informed by our up-to-date knowledge of the pharmacology of THC and CBD. 
- There maybe a conflict of interest in their information.
